## Project Details
I have added quotation management to keep track of all the quotations made by the user. 

When you first click the you will see the login page. After you login, you will be at the quotation page. 

This is where you can add quotations to your list. Select the products using the drop down menu, click add button to insert into the collection which is shown on the right table. 

Later, you can click save button to save the button to save your collection to the database. You will also get a notification when you save. 

To check quotations history, you can navigate to quotation management in the to Nav Bar. Here you will see all the quotations made by the user with ascending ordered date. 

You can add more quotaions by clicking "add more quotation" which will redirect you to the Quotation page. Before adding more quotations, make sure to clear since there will be previous quotations.

Lastly, the product list shown in the Quotation page can be modified in the product page in the nav bar.
